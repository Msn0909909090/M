You can use a formula to take weather data into consideration to update this field, e.g. =IF(Weather!C2>30, TRUE, FALSE) will cause the line item to be activated if the temperature of the first station in the Weather tab is above 30 degrees. Leave this field empty if you don't want it to be modified by the tool.",
      "The 'Fixed Bid' column of the Rules tab allows you to control the fixed bid amount of the line item. The value set to this field will be applied to the specified line item. You can use a formula to take weather data into consideration to update this field, e.g. =IF(Weather!G2>3, 0.7, 0.4) will cause bid to be set to $0.7 if the wind speed of the first line in the Weather tab is greater than 3 mph, or $0.4 otherwise. Leave this field empty if you don't want it to be modified by the tool."
